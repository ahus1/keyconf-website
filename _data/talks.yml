    In Europe, interest in De-centralized Identity (DID) and Self-sovereign identity (SSI) are increasing as the European Commission released "The European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework" for eIDAS 2.0. The latest Keycloak supported an experimental feature OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) for this emerging paradigm of identity by keycloak's community like OAuth SIG.  In his talk, Takashi describes the OID4VCI support provided by Keycloak in detail. He also outlines a plan to enhance this experimental OID4VCI support in the future. Additionally, he discusses Keycloak's latest compliance with FAPI 2.0 and OAuth 2.1.

  speaker: mpo

    In this talk, Marek will highlight the most important features, which were contributed to the Keycloak in the past year. He will focus on the core features related to user experience and realm administration. The special focus will be on those features:
    <dl>
    <dt>User profile<dt>
    <dd>User profile provides fine-grained control over the attributes that users and administrators can manage so that you can prevent unexpected attributes and values from being set. In the session, we will show how administrator can configure user profile attributes, provide the validations and custom annotations with the details on how the attributes will be shown on the user forms. Also we will touch on progressive profiling, which provides ability to specify that some fields are required or available on the forms just for particular values of scope parameter.</dd>
    <dt>Organizations<dt>
    <dd>This is brand new feature added as a preview in Keycloak 25, which provides a realm with some core multi-tenancy capabilities with the possibility to address Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Business-to-Customers (B2B2C) use cases.</dd>
    </dl>
    If time permits and there is an interest, we can touch on management on possible ideas for the future roadmap.
    This session is ideal for Keycloak administrators and developers.
