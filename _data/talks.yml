- title: "MFA, passwordless authentication and the lost phone"
  speaker: nko
  abstract: |
    Keycloak has recently expanded the default multi-factor authentication (MFA) options with supported Recovery Codes, which you can use if you don’t have access to your OTP device (e.g. your phone) and WebAuthN. The latest release also improved the user experience dramatically for passwordless authentication using Passkeys.
    <p> 
    In my talk, I will explain how to use MFA correctly, what it is and what it is not. Afterwards, I’ll show hands-on how to configure Keycloak for proper MFA usage and how you also can use passwordless authentication using Passkeys in parallel to traditional authentication with username, password and MFA.

  speaker: tno
  abstract: |
    In this talk, Takashi investigates the possibility of integrating Keycloak with AI agents.
    <p>
    In the field of AI agents, Model Context Protocol (MCP) becomes a hot topic, which makes it easy for an AI agent/tool to connect internal/external services.
    <p>
    When an AI agent/tool implementing an MCP client accesses a remote external service implementing an MCP server, end user authentication and authorization is sometimes required. According to the MCP specification, OAuth 2.1 needs to be used for that, which implies that there is the possibility of using Keycloak for end user authentication and authorization because Keycloak supported OAuth 2.1.
    <p>
    Firstly, Takashi talks about MCP briefly and describes end user authentication and authorization of MCP in more detail. After that, the speaker shows the possible system configuration that includes Keycloak as a part of the MCP server.

- title: "Keycloak & OpenID Federation: Empowering Dynamic Trust in Federated Environments"
  speaker: kge
  abstract: |
    This session will explore our journey to integrate OpenID Federation support into Keycloak to enable participation in an identity federation of entities using OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. OpenID Federation offers a robust framework for establishing dynamic trust between OpenID Providers (OPs) and Relying Parties (RPs), significantly simplifying the management of large-scale identity federations. By leveraging this specification, Keycloak will enable the dynamic establishment of trust between OPs and RPs, facilitate secure interactions authenticated via Trust Anchors, and crucially, eliminate the need for cumbersome manual or bilateral trust agreements. We'll demonstrate our progress in implementing OpenID Federation support for Keycloak and outline our ongoing plan to integrate this essential functionality into Keycloak's core through collaborative efforts and pull requests with the Keycloak team and the Keycloak OAuth SIG group.
    <p>
    As a foundational step, we aim to enable Keycloak to seamlessly support both explicit and automatic client registration under OpenID Federation, acting as both an OP and an RP within the identity federation using OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. We'll show how to enable and configure OpenID Federation on a per-realm basis through the admin console using mandatory and optional realm settings. Our presentation will delve into the REST API and code implementation, with a particular focus on the explicit registration process. We'll also engage in a discussion about outstanding issues, open technical challenges, and future considerations, including the implementation of other OpenID Federation components.
    <p>
    A key use case for this development is the EOSC Beyond project, where Keycloak-powered identity and access management services will participate in the European Open Science Cloud identity federation, leveraging the OpenID Federation specification. This will greatly simplify integration and enhance scalability across the EOSC ecosystem by enabling secure, interoperable access to resources. To bring it all to life, we'll offer a practical demonstration showcasing OpenID Federation in the project context.
